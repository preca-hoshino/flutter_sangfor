## Unreleased

* `SangforTcpTerminator` negotiates TCP window scaling (RFC 7323) and
  advertises a 1 MiB window by default instead of the 64 KB the bare header
  field holds. One terminated connection used to keep at most 64 KB in flight,
  which capped its throughput at `64 KB / round trip` -- and that round trip
  runs through the host's own event loop, so it stretched out exactly when the
  host was busy. A peer that does not offer the option falls back to the
  unscaled 16-bit field, so the default is safe to send.
* The two settings are named once, as `sangforTcpScaledWindow` /
  `sangforTcpUnscaledWindow` / `sangforTcpWindowScaleShift`, so a host that
  exposes the choice (ShuVPN's experimental page) writes the same numbers the
  constructor defaults use. Turning scaling off means passing the unscaled
  pair, which is byte-for-byte the old behaviour.
* `SangforTcpPacketBuilder.build` takes a `windowScale` option and
  `SangforTcpSegment` parses it. Both options are padded to a 32-bit boundary.
* The iOS terminator (`ATrustTcpTerminator`) mirrors this: its `Configuration`
  carries the same `advertisedWindow` / `windowScale` pair and negotiates the
  option the same way, so the two data planes do not diverge. The Swift packet
  codec gains a `windowScale` parameter and `ATrustTcpSegmentHeader.windowScale`.

## 0.0.12

* `VpnTunnelService` overrides `onRevoke()` and reports it to Dart as
  `AndroidVpnDevice.revocations`. Until now the system taking the tunnel away
  -- the user switching the VPN off in system settings or from the
  quick-settings tile, or another `VpnService` taking over -- was invisible to
  the app: no event fired, the packet loop kept reading a descriptor the kernel
  had already closed, and `getState()` kept answering `connected`.
* The revocation is reported from `onRevoke()` rather than `onDestroy()`,
  because `onDestroy` also runs on an ordinary in-app `vpnStop` and would
  announce a revocation on every normal disconnect. For the same reason it
  clears the cached state behind `getState()`: unlike a disconnect the app
  asked for, nothing follows a revocation with a `vpnStop`.
* Both `flutter_sangfor/service` streams install the single native handler they
  share, so `revocations` works on its own instead of depending on something
  having subscribed to `disconnectRequests` first.

## 0.0.11

* Fix iOS builds by distinguishing manager and data plane errors and converting
  the TLS trust wrapper to `SecTrust` for certificate pinning. Keep IPv6 parsing compatible
  with the package's iOS 15 deployment target.

## 0.0.10

* `SangforTunnelInstalledDaemon.diagnoseUnavailable()` explains *why* there is
  no daemon, instead of the bare `null` that `connect()` returns so callers can
  fall back quietly. The causes need different fixes and look identical from the
  outside: nothing installed, a configuration written by another version, an app
  update that moved the executable out from under the logon task, and a task
  that has not run since it was installed. Returns `null` when a daemon *is*
  reachable, so it is safe to call unconditionally.
* `SangforTunnelHostConfig.installedFrom` carries the path the daemon's
  `--install` recorded. The daemon warns at startup when it is running from
  somewhere else, which is what makes a relocated install visible rather than a
  tunnel that silently stops working at the next logon.
## 0.0.9

* Add a client for `sangfor-tunneld`, the process that runs the Rust data plane
  outside the app: `SangforTunnelDaemon`, with two ways to get one.
  `SangforTunnelInstalledDaemon.connect()` finds a daemon installed as an
  elevated logon task by reading the configuration in the user's profile, which
  is what removes the elevation requirement on Windows — creating a wintun
  adapter needs an elevated process, and an app that runs `asInvoker` cannot do
  it at all. `SangforTunnelDaemonProcess.start()` launches the binary as a
  child, which inherits the app's privileges and so is for `loopback` and
  `--dry-run` work.
* Both drive the same control protocol — `start`, `status`, `stopSession`,
  `stop` — over a token-gated loopback socket. The daemon outlives its
  sessions, so one elevated process serves repeated connect/disconnect cycles.
* `SangforTunnelHostConfig` and `SangforTunnelSnapshot` model the daemon's two
  documents. Decoding is lenient where the daemon's own parsing is strict, so a
  newer daemon that adds a field does not break an older app.
* A session plan is handed over by **path**, never inline: it carries the
  request signing key, and the control channel is reachable by any local process
  that has the token.
## 0.0.8

* Keep the extension-native tunnel alive across a restart: the session plan is
  written with "complete until first user authentication" protection (iOS may
  bring the tunnel back after a reboot or a network change with the device
  still locked) and is only wiped on a user-initiated, provider-disabled, or
  app-update stop instead of every stop.
## 0.0.7

* Add the iOS extension-native data plane: `IosVpnRuntimeMode.extensionNative`,
  `IosVpnDevice.startNative`, and `writeSessionPlan`/`clearSessionPlan` hand a
  session plan to the packet tunnel extension through the App Group, and the
  extension then runs the tunnel itself — L3 handshake, per-flow auth,
  heartbeats, reconnect, TCP-tunnel dials, and local TCP termination. The VPN
  keeps carrying traffic when iOS suspends the app, which the loopback bridge
  could never do. The bridge stays the default.
* The native core is pure Swift and verified off-device: SHA-256/HMAC, a JSON
  writer that reproduces Dart's `jsonEncode` byte for byte, the L3 and TCP
  tunnel frame codecs, the IPv4/TCP builder with full checksums, route
  matching, the flow tracker, the userspace TCP terminator, and the L3
  connection driver. `tool/run_swift_tests.sh` (or `.ps1`) checks all of it
  against golden fixtures emitted by the Dart reference implementation.
* Fix a TCP terminator stall: the ACK comparison was inverted, so a cumulative
  ACK covering more than one segment never advanced the send window and the
  flow hung after its first window of data.
* Pin node certificates with the gateway's salted digest
  (`SangforCertificateDigest`) instead of a plain SHA-256 of the DER.
* Advertise the system proxy only in loopback-bridge mode; the native plane
  terminates those flows itself and must not point apps at a proxy that only
  exists while the Runner is awake.
## 0.0.7

* Add the iOS extension-native data plane: the packet tunnel extension can run
  the tunnel itself (`IosVpnRuntimeMode.extensionNative`,
  `IosVpnDevice.startNative`) from a session plan handed over through the App
  Group (`IosVpnDevice.writeSessionPlan` / `clearSessionPlan`), so the VPN
  survives the Runner being suspended. The loopback bridge stays the default.
* Add the pure-Swift core that plane runs on: SHA-256/HMAC, a canonical JSON
  writer that matches Dart's `jsonEncode` byte for byte, the L3 and TCP-tunnel
  frame codecs, the IPv4/TCP packet builder with full checksums, route
  matching, the userspace TCP terminator, and the L3 connection driver with
  per-flow auth, heartbeats, and reconnect. `tool/run_swift_tests.sh` compiles
  and checks all of it against golden fixtures emitted by the Dart reference
  implementation, on Linux, Windows, and macOS.
* Fix a TCP terminator stall: the acknowledgement comparison was inverted, so a
  cumulative ACK covering more than one segment never advanced the send window
  and the connection hung after its first window of data.
* Pin node certificates with the gateway's salted digest
  (`SangforCertificateDigest`) rather than a plain SHA-256 of the DER.
## 0.0.6

* Add the userspace TCP terminator (`SangforTcpTerminator`,
  `SangforTerminatingTunnel`): a packet device can now serve TCP flows the
  tunnel refuses to forward as raw IP by completing the handshake locally and
  relaying bytes through a `SangforTcpDialer`. Ships an IPv4/TCP codec with
  full checksums, MSS clamping, retransmission with exponential backoff, peer
  window flow control, and upstream backpressure.
* Add `SangforSystemProxy`, which publishes a loopback HTTP proxy as the
  OS-wide proxy on Windows (WinINET keys under `HKCU`, no elevation needed) and
  macOS (`networksetup`, administrator rights), capturing and restoring
  whatever the user had configured before.
* Advertise a system proxy from the iOS packet tunnel:
  `IosVpnDevice.start(proxyHost:, proxyPort:)` now reaches `NEProxySettings`
  with an all-hosts match domain, the counterpart of Android's
  `VpnService.Builder.setHttpProxy`.
## 0.0.5

* Fix the ohos ArkTS build: NetAddress.family is a plain number in the
  OpenHarmony SDK (no connection.NetFamily enum), RouteInfo.gateway is
  mandatory, and Index.ets imports must precede exports.

## 0.0.4

* Add the HarmonyOS VpnExtensionAbility adapter (ohos module, SCM_RIGHTS
  TUN fd hand-off) and the OhosVpnDevice Dart adapter.
## 0.0.3

* Fix an Android ANR: establish the tunnel from a background executor instead
  of blocking the platform thread while the service comes up.
* Fall back to the underlying network's DNS resolvers when the server
  publishes none, and keep those resolvers outside the TUN routes.
* Advertise the caller's loopback HTTP proxy as the VPN system proxy on
  Android 13+ so domain-published resources work in system mode.
* Add a persistent notification with live speed, uptime, and a disconnect
  action; dismissed notifications recover via the delete intent.
* Add `AndroidVpnDevice.updateStats` and `disconnectRequests` plumbing.
* BREAKING CHANGE: rename the Android namespace from
  `com.tsinbeilabs.flutter_sangfor` to `com.tsinbei.flutter_sangfor`.
## 0.0.2

* Add library-level dartdoc for the public API surface.
* Update the package description to cover aTrust and Easy Connect.

  with egress/ingress filters and cancellation-token support.
* Add `SangforSocks5Server` (RFC 1928 no-auth CONNECT) with pipelined-request
  buffering, serialized sends, and cancellation-token support.
* Add EasyConnect TCP-over-L3 synthesis: IPv4/TCP/UDP packet building,
  DNS query/parse over the tunnel, a retransmitting client TCP state machine
  with zero-window probing, and a `dialTcp` connector API.
* Add platform TUN adapters: `WintunDevice` (Windows), `TunDevice` (Linux),
  `AndroidVpnDevice` (VpnService), `UtunDevice` (macOS), and `IosVpnDevice`
  (NetworkExtension packet tunnel with loopback IPC).
